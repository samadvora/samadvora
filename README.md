INTERNSHIPS AND PROJECTS:

-->In the final year of my undergraduate degree, I developed a project "E-voting system" with a blockchain mechanism. It is an android based application to automize the procedure for voting for different elections. The voting procedure thus becomes automatic through this application. A blockchain mechanism was implemented to secure app data and the procedure of the election. This project taught me how to
take a real-life problem and come up with a solution to resolve that problem using and applying my technical skills. 

-->I undertook an internship at Svaapta It-Ally Solutions Pvt Ltd. The agenda behind taking this internship
was to put my learning into practice from  courses to real-time Computer Science projects. I got to work with multiple projects in the areas of Software development and designing.
